					I'm getting rid of all my books to finance a Kindle purchase. Everything's at rock bottom 
					prices and in great condition. No haggling for individual books but if you want to buy two 
					or more we can cut a deal. I'm happy to ship at your expense but unless 
					you're buying a number of books it's probably not worth your while.
				
					To buy email me at [jimwhimpey@me.com](mailto:jimwhimpey@me.com)
